The code can be cloned from Git at: https://github.com/CRDougan/FizzBuzz.git

I used Eclipse Neon with Spring Framework support to run the web service locally. Simply running it from Eclipse should start a tomcat instance so that you can use localhost:8088.

NOTE that I switched the localhost to 8088 from 8080 in my project due to some personal environment reasons.

Once the application is running, open a web browser and navigate to:
http://localhost:8088/FizzBuzz/15

You can replace "15" with any positive integer.
